ESP32 DHT22 TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MONITOR (WITH LED INDICATOR)

THIS PROJECT USES AN ESP32 AND A DHT22 SENSOR TO READ TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY VALUES AND DISPLAY THEM ON THE SERIAL MONITOR.
IF THE TEMPERATURE GOES ABOVE 30°C, THE LED CONNECTED TO GPIO2 TURNS ON AUTOMATICALLY.
WHEN THE TEMPERATURE DROPS BELOW 30°C, THE LED TURNS OFF.

THIS PROJECT SHOWS BASIC SENSOR INTERFACING, SERIAL COMMUNICATION, AND GPIO CONTROL USING THE ESP32 MICROCONTROLLER.

HARDWARE CONNECTIONS
COMPONENT	ESP32 PIN
DHT22 VCC	3.3V
DHT22 GND	GND
DHT22 DATA	GPIO4
LED + (ANODE)	GPIO2
LED - (CATHODE)	GND

NOTE: IF YOU ARE USING WOKWI, SELECT THE DHT22 COMPONENT AND CONNECT ITS DATA PIN TO GPIO4.

-HOW THE PROJECT WORKS

THE ESP32 INITIALIZES THE DHT22 SENSOR AND STARTS THE SERIAL MONITOR.
EVERY 2 SECONDS, IT READS TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY FROM THE SENSOR.
THE VALUES ARE PRINTED ON THE SERIAL MONITOR.
IF THE TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE 30°C, THE LED TURNS ON.
IF THE TEMPERATURE IS 30°C OR BELOW, THE LED TURNS OFF.

-ARDUINO CODE (MAIN.INO)

#include "DHT.h"

#define DHTPIN 4
#define DHTTYPE DHT22
#define LEDPIN 2

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  dht.begin();
  pinMode(LEDPIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.println("ESP32 + DHT22 + LED READY!");
}

void loop() {
  float temp = dht.readTemperature();
  float hum = dht.readHumidity();

  Serial.print("TEMPERATURE: ");
  Serial.print(temp);
  Serial.print(" °C  |  HUMIDITY: ");
  Serial.println(hum);

  if (temp > 30) {
    digitalWrite(LEDPIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(LEDPIN, LOW);
  }

  delay(2000);
}
